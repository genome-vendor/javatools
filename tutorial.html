<h1>Packaging Java with Javatools</h1>

<p>Javatools replaces the existing jarwrapper package and also contains
programs to help packagers in creating packages for Java programs and
libraries.</p>

<h2>Packaging tools</h2>

<p>The javahelper package consists of several small programs which make
packaging Java programs and libraries easier. They are generally
designed to work in the same fashion as the debhelper programs, but
start with the <code>jh_</code> prefix.</p>

<p>All of the programs have their command line arguments documented in
manpages.</p>

<h2>jh_build</h2>

<p>Many Java programs and libraries are distributed without sane build
systems. <code>jh_build</code> provides a simple interface for building Java
source code into Jars, including setting the appropriate entries in
the manifest.</p>

<p>In almost all cases all that needs to be done to call <code>jh_build</code> is to
set <code>JAVA_HOME</code> and <code>CLASSPATH</code> and then call <code>jh_build</code> with the name of
the jar and the directory containing the source.</p>

<pre><code>JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/esd.jar:/usr/share/java/jsch.jar
jh_build weirdx.jar src
</code></pre>

<p>This command will compile all the Java files under src, set the
classpath in the manifest and build it all into weirdx.jar.</p>

<p>A couple of other options are worth mentioning. If this jar contains
an application rather than a library then the -m or --main option can
be used to set the Main-Class attribute in the manifest which will
allow the resulting jar file to be be executed</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may provide a debian/javabuild file containing one
jar per line, each jar name followed by a list of source files or
directories. In this case you can call <code>jh_build</code> with no jar or source
and it will build those jars. The jars will then be removed by
<code>jh_build --clean</code>.</p>

<p><code>jh_build</code> also provides a --clean parameter which should be called in
the clean target of debian/rules. It is called for you by <code>jh_clean</code></p>

<p><code>jh_build</code> will also create javadoc, but only for the last jar built in
each package. It can be installed automatically using
<code>jh_installjavadoc</code> (see below).</p>

<h2>jh_installlibs</h2>

<p>For library packages Debian Java policy currently requires that the
libraries be installed to /usr/share/java in a versioned format and
with an unversioned symlink. <code>jh_installlibs</code> will take a jar and
correctly install it.</p>

<p>As with debhelper programs, this can either take a jar as a parameter,
or read a list of jars from a file in the Debian directory. It also
follows the -p, -i and -a semantics of debhelper for selecting which
packages to install the jar to. When operating on a package,
<code>jh_installlibs</code> will read the list of library jars from
debian/package.jlibs or debian/jlibs.</p>

<p>The jlibs file is a list of jars to install, one per line, and works
exactly the same as listing them on the command line. Each jar is
installed to debian/$package/usr/share/java/ in the appropriate
versioned and unversioned forms.</p>

<p>If the jars built by upstream already contain the version number, this
will be stripped before installing. <code>jh_installlibs</code> will also try to
strip the upstream version number of any dfsg suffix. Other
version-mangling options or explicit version numbers can also be
provided.</p>

<h2>jh_depends</h2>

<p><code>jh_depends</code> works like <code>dpkg-shlibdeps</code>, but for jar files. For each jar
in the package it takes the jars on which it depends and finds the
packages to which they belong. These are included in the debhelper
substvars as ${java:Depends}. The control file can then just list that
variable which is filled in automatically.</p>

<p>This is done by reading the Class-Path attribute from the manifest of
each jar. Jar files should include this attribute to prevent
applications which use them from needing a full recursive classpath in
their startup scripts and to prevent unneccessary transitions when the
library changes its dependencies. If the package is not built with
<code>jh_build</code> and the upstream build system does not set it correctly then
<code>jh_manifest</code> or <code>jh_classpath</code> can be used to fix this.</p>

<p>If the application uses executable jars (see Runtime support below)
then <code>jh_depends</code> will also add the appropriate depends on jarwrapper
and the correct Java runtime.</p>

<p>As of version 0.32, <code>jh_depends</code> also checks installed javadocs for
links to system installed javadocs. It will use this to populate the
${java:Recommends} variable, which can be used for the doc package.</p>

<p>Note that both substvars are always created even if they are empty,
like debhelper does with ${misc:Depends}.</p>

<h2>jh_manifest</h2>

<p>Many upstream build systems do not set the Class-Path attribute in the
jars they create. This leads to several unwanted problems, such as
expanding the classpath which applications have to use and introducing
unneccessary transitions. They also may not set the Main-Class
attribute. Both of these are required for running jars with the -jar
parameter.</p>

<p><code>jh_manifest</code> can fix the manifest files of jars. It can either read
from a manifest file in the Debian directory or run in a mode which
updates all the jars with the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable.</p>

<p>The manifest files can either be debian/package.manifest or
debian/manifest. The format of this file is a list of jars and
indented below each one a list of manifest elements to set:</p>

<pre><code>usr/share/weirdx/weirdx.jar:
 Main-Class: com.jcraft.weirdx.WeirdX
 Debian-Java-Home: /usr/lib/jvm/default-java
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Prior to javahelper 0.32 (0.33 if you used cdbs), <code>jh_manifest</code> would
be run before <code>jh_installlibs</code>.  In these versions the jars were usually
referred to by their location in the build directories rather than their
install location.</p>

<h2>jh_classpath</h2>

<p>If you are just setting the classpath then this command is simpler
than <code>jh_manifest</code>. <code>jh_classpath</code> can either take jars on the command
line with the classpath specified on the command line or in the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it can read classpaths from a debian/classpath or
debian/package.classpath file. This should be one jar per line
specifying the jar followed by it's space-separated classpath:</p>

<pre><code>usr/share/java/bar.jar /usr/share/java/quux.jar
usr/share/java/foo.jar /usr/share/java/bar.jar /usr/share/java/baz.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Prior to javahelper 0.32 (0.33 if you used cdbs), <code>jh_classpath</code> would
be run before <code>jh_installlibs</code>.  In these versions the jars were usually
referred to by their location in the build directories rather than their
install location.</p>

<h2>jh_exec</h2>

<p>The Runtime support section below describes running executable jars
directly. <code>jh_exec</code> will scan package directories for jars in the paths,
or symlinks to jar from the paths, and ensure that they have been set
executable if necessary.</p>

<h2>jh_installjavadoc</h2>

<p>If you have javadoc which has been built by your build system, then
<code>jh_installjavadoc</code> will install it in the correct location and register
it with doc-base for you. Either run <code>jh_installjavadoc</code> with the
directory containing the javadoc as a parameter, or it will read
debian/javadoc or debian/$package.javadoc which should contain a single
path to the javadoc for that package.</p>

<p>If you have used <code>jh_build</code> that will automatically have created
javadoc.  To install that put the string "internal" in the javadoc
file and it will be installed.</p>

<p>The second parameter, or the second string on the line in the javadoc
file, can be used to override the install location, for example, so
that a -doc package can install to /usr/share/doc/$library/api.</p>

<h2>jh_linkjars</h2>

<p>If upstream ship convenience copies of third-party jar files which
have been removed (see <code>jh_repack</code> below), but the build system refers
to that directory, <code>jh_linkjars</code> can be used to populate the directory
with symlinks to the packaged jars in /usr/share/java.</p>

<p>It is called either with a directory on the command line or by
specifying one target directory per line in the file debian/linkjars.</p>

<p><code>jh_linkjars</code> will scan all of the (installed) build-dependencies and
create a symlink to every jar which is installed by those packages in
the target directory.</p>

<p><code>jh_linkjars</code> can be called with -u to remove all the symlinks in the
clean target.  This is done automatically by <code>jh_clean</code>.</p>

<h2>jh_clean</h2>

<p><code>jh_clean</code> removes any files which have been created during the build by
other <code>jh_</code> commands, such as <code>jh_build</code> and <code>jh_linkjars</code></p>

<h2>jh_makepkg</h2>

<p><code>jh_makepkg</code> will create template Debian packages for Java programs and
libraries similar to <code>dh-make</code>. It should be run in the source directory
and it will create the orig.tar.gz and most of the files in the Debian
directory, which need only small changes neccessary to build the
package.</p>

<h2>jh_repack</h2>

<p><code>jh_repack</code> provides functionality to help clean your upstream tarball
of prebuilt jars, classfiles and javadoc. If you want to do this
whenever you download a new version you can use <code>jh_repack</code> as a uscan
helper. Just put <code>jh_repack</code> as the command at the end of the uscan
line. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>version=3
http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/salliere/ (?:.*/)?salliere-?_?([\d+\.]+|\d+)\.(tar.*|tgz|zip|gz|bz2|) debian jh_repack
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively you can run it by hand:</p>

<pre><code>jh_repack --upstream-version &lt;version&gt; &lt;tarball&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>jh_repack</code> will remove any .class files, any .jar files, the whole
directory tree containing javadoc and any empty directories as a
result of the above.</p>

<h2>java-propose-classpath</h2>

<p>Some upstreams have complicated classpaths which may not be obvious to
the packager when using <code>jh_manifest</code> to set the Class-Path attribute.
<code>java-propose-classpath</code> will unpack a jar and look at the symbols
imported to the class files, then scan all the jars in
/usr/share/java. This should not be run in the build since it is slow,
and there may be ambiguities that the packager must resolve. It is
still very useful for the packager as most of the time it will get it
right automatically.</p>

<p>To avoid bloating the recursive build-deps of packages,
<code>java-propose-classpath</code> is in a separate package to javahelper. It
should not be on any package's build-depends.</p>

<h2>jh_installeclipse</h2>

<p><code>jh_installeclipse</code> will install eclipse features built by eclipse's
pde-build script. It supports most of debhelpers normal
options. Features can either be put in the $package.eh-install or be
given per command-line. By default <code>jh_installeclipse</code> expects
pde-build to have been run from debian/.eclipse-build; if you decide
to run it from another directory, you should use --pde-build-dir to
tell <code>jh_installeclipse</code> where pde-build was run from.</p>

<p><code>jh_installeclipse</code> knows where pde-build dumps its output, so only the
name of the feature should be given. It supports file globbing both in
the files and per command-line (though in the latter case your shell
may attempt to expand the globs if they are not properly escaped or
quoted).</p>

<p>Due two the way the underlying build system works; orbit dependencies
will be embedded directly into the installation. <code>jh_installeclipse</code>
will replace any orbit dependencies imported by
<code>jh_generateorbitdir</code>. If you add/import orbit dependencies yourself
through other means, you must replace them yourselves after running
<code>jh_installeclipse</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>jh_installeclipse</code> will output a ${orbit:Depends} variable
if it replaces any orbit dependency for that package.</p>

<h2>jh_generateorbitdir</h2>

<p><code>jh_generateorbitdir</code> is an javahelper program that handles creation
of an orbit dependency dir. This directory has to be populated with
non-eclipse jar files. However, eclipse refers to these jars by their
"symbolic name". <code>jh_generateorbitdir</code> can extract this name from the
jar's manifest (provided it has the OSGi metadata) and create a
symlink to it.</p>

<p><code>jh_generateorbitdir</code> will replace regular files with symlinks if they
are present in the orbit dir and clash with the name of one of the
orbit jars. If an orbit jar name clashes with a symlink in the orbit
dir, then <code>jh_generateorbitdir</code> will assume that the given jar has
already been symlinked and skip it.</p>

<p><code>jh_generateorbitdir</code> will also check the default installation for jar
files on Debian systems (at the time of writing /usr/share/java), if
it cannot find the jar in the current dir.</p>

<p>If present, <code>jh_generateorbitdir</code> will read debian/eclipse.orbitdeps and
add the jar files listed in it to the list of orbit dependencies.</p>

<h2>jh_setupenvironment</h2>

<p><code>jh_setupenvironment</code> is a javahelper program that handles creating an
environment for building an eclipse feature. It does not setup an
orbit dir (use <code>jh_generateorbitdir</code> for that). It will copy files
specified in debian/eclipse.environment as well as those given on
command line into the environment dir. If no files are given per
command line and the environment file is not present (or is empty), it
will default to org.eclipse.*</p>

<h2>jh_compilefeatures</h2>

<p><code>jh_compilefeatures</code> handles compilation of eclipse features. It will
read debian/eclipse.features as a list of features to compile and
their dependencies. The first item on a line is the id of the feature
and the remaining are either ids of previously compiled features or
features installed on the system (identified by the folder they are
installed in).</p>

<p>By default <code>jh_compilefeatures</code> will set the source and the target
version of the class files to 1.5. This can be overriden by explicitly
changing the build options (see man <code>jh_compilefeatures</code> for more
information).</p>

<h2>java-vars.mk</h2>

<p>You can include /usr/share/javahelper/java-vars.mk in your
debian/rules to get the following variables defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>JAVA_HOME</code></p>

<p>If you have not already set it, will default to the default JDK for
the architecture (you must depend on default-jdk or -headless if
you are not overriding this).  To override this set <code>JAVA_HOME</code>
<em>before</em> including java-vars.mk</p></li>
<li><p><code>JAVA_ARCH</code></p>

<p>The JVM version of the build architecture (eg ppc not powerpc)</p></li>
<li><p><code>JRE_HOME</code></p>

<p>If <code>$JAVA_HOME/jre</code> exists then that, otherwise <code>$JAVA_HOME</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>JVM_CLIENT_DIR</code> and <code>JVM_SERVER_DIR</code></p>

<p>Set if the respective types of JVM are installed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you need the Java architecture in a non-make context then you can
use /usr/share/javahelper/java-arch.sh instead.</p>

<h1>Runtime support</h1>

<p>Javatools also provides some runtime support. Unlike compiled
programs, or purely interpreted programs with hash-bang lines, Java
programs cannot be directly executed. Many upstreams expect them to be
run using java -jar jarname or java classname. This is not generally
acceptible in systems which expect to just be able to run the command
or launch it from a menu. As a result, many packagers are writing
wrapper scripts which just call java with the correct classpath, jar
and main class.</p>

<h2>jarwrapper</h2>

<p>There is an alternative to wrapper scripts, however. The binfmt_misc
kernel module allows the kernel to call out to a program in userspace
to execute specific types of file. jarwrapper registers itself as a
handler for executable jars. This is done by reading values from the
manifest file.</p>

<p>In order for executable jars to work the following attributes must or
may be defined in the manifest. These attributes can be set using
<code>jh_build</code> and <code>jh_manifest</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Main-Class: The name of the class to be run when the application
starts. (REQUIRED)</p></li>
<li><p>Class-Path: The path to all the jar files on which this jar
depends. (REQUIRED unless empty)</p></li>
<li><p>Debian-Java-Home: A Debian-specific property if this application
depends on a specific runtime. Specify the path to the runtime
which should be used. Multiple space-separated paths may be given
if any of the runtimes will work. (OPTIONAL)</p></li>
<li><p>Debian-Java-Parameters: A Debian-specific property if this
application needs extra options to the JVM. (OPTIONAL)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Java Architecture</h2>

<p>If you need to know the JVM architecture name at runtime (for example
to put libjvm.so on the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>) then jarwrapper also provides
/usr/share/jarwrapper/java-arch.sh which will either print the current
one or convert a debian arch name to a JVM arch name.</p>

<h1>Putting it together</h1>

<h2>Using javahelper with CDBS</h2>

<p>Javahelper 0.18 introduces a CDBS class for javahelper. It runs all
the <code>jh_</code> commands after <code>dh_install*</code> and <code>dh_link</code> and has options
for running <code>jh_build</code> under the build target.</p>

<p>The <code>jh_</code> commands are invoked once per package. You can pass options to
all the invocations using the <code>JH_EXEC_ARGS</code>, <code>JH_INSTALLLIBS_ARGS</code>,
<code>JH_MANIFEST_ARGS</code> and <code>JH_DEPENDS_ARGS</code> variables.</p>

<p>To invoke <code>jh_build</code> you must either set <code>JH_BUILD_JAR</code> and
<code>JH_BUILD_SOURCE</code> and <code>JAVA_HOME</code> or have a debian/javabuild file and
set <code>JAVA_HOME</code>.  Optionally you can also set <code>CLASSPATH</code> and
<code>JH_BUILD_ARGS</code>.</p>

<p>Please note: you <em>MUST</em> include javahelper.mk before ant.mk.</p>

<p>The above debian/rules can be rewritten with CDBS as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/make -f
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/csv.jar:/usr/share/java/debug-disable.jar:/usr/share/java/itext.jar
JH_BUILD_JAR=salliere.jar
JH_BUILD_SRC=src

include /usr/share/cdbs/1/class/javahelper.mk
</code></pre>

<h2>Using javahelper with dh</h2>

<p>Javahelper 0.20 introduces a dh extension for javahelper. It runs all
the <code>jh_</code> commands after <code>dh_install*</code> and <code>dh_link</code> and also runs
<code>jh_build</code> if you have a debian/javabuild file.</p>

<p>The above debian/rules can be rewritten with dh 7 as follows:</p>

<p>debian/javabuild</p>

<pre><code>salliere.jar src
</code></pre>

<p>debian/rules</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/make -f

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
